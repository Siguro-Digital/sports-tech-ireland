		<p>20 women have graduated from Ireland's first 'Digital Athlete' programme, a new collaboration between
			Technology Ireland Digital Skillnet and Sports Tech Ireland. Digital Athlete is a new career pathway into
			the growing area of sports technology in Ireland. Sports tech companies work across loT, sports performance,
			data analytics, broadcast, wearable tech, fan engagement, e-sports and sports e-commerce.</p>
		<img src="/assets/img/women.jpg" alt="Group of woman">
		<p>The ten-week intensive programme combines data skills and professional acumen to provide a combination of
			knowledge and skills that are specifically aligned to the sports analytics industry. The first 20 graduates
			were recognised at an event held during the recent One Zero sports conference at the Aviva Stadium.</p>
		<p>The new 'Digital Athlete' programme participants will now progress to a three-month mentored work placement
			in companies such as Orecco, Stats Perform, Epic Global, Statsports, and Output Sports, while also working
			in national sports organisations like Badminton Ireland.</p>
		<p>Grainne Barry, SVP Operations, Stats Perform and co-founder of Sports Tech Ireland said: "Like all
			industries, the industry of sport has changed as teams, leagues, broadcasters, have embraced new
			technologies and digital opportunities. Data, digital, people and culture are converging to position Ireland
			at the centre of the growing sports tech industry. Nationally we have an ecosystem of indigenous and FDI
			companies, creating a centre of excellence to leverage the opportunities from a Sports Data Analytics market
			predicted to reach almost €6bn by 2026".</p>
		<p>Commenting on the programme, Máire Hunt Director of the Technology Ireland Digital Skillet highlighted the
			importance of cross-skilling to prepare candidates for convergent careers in the sector. She said: "By
			combining technology and business skills with an understanding of the sports domain we are generating new
			and diverse source of talent for the sector. This programme is unique in its ability to interact with
			SportsTech company leaders and give participants the opportunity to see what it's like actually working in
			sports tech company."</p>
		<p>In 2023, the partnership of the Technology Ireland Digital Skillnet and Sports Tech Ireland will bring a new
			suite of programmes to sports tech. This will enable the sector to broaden its appeal by providing
			continuous professional a development with a Postgrad Diploma in Sports Technology and Analytics and the
			development of 'second career' digital conversion models for athletes.</p>
